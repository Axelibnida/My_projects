# Projects

I will share here some personal data and ML projects I did, using Python and the Jupyter Notebook so far.

* The **Counterfeit detection** project is one I did in the context of my Data Analyst training. I am using Linear Regression to predict some missing values, and
  Logistic Regression as well as Classification with K-Means Clustering to predict weither new examples are in fact legit bills, or counterfeit ones.
  The way the project had to be done was totally free: the programming language, the code used, etc. The only requirement was to respect the specifications.
