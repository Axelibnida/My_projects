# Projects

I will share here some personal data and ML projects I did, so far using Python and the Jupyter Notebook.

* In the **Data Cleaning & Analysis** project, the focus is on cleaning data and descriptive analysis. The dataset is relatively heavy (320772, 162) and quite dirty.
  * Data cleaning notebook
  * Descriptive analysis notebook
  * Powerpoint presentation

* The **Counterfeit detection** project is one I did in the context of my Data Analyst training. I am using simple ML techniques: Linear Regression to predict some missing values, and Logistic Regression as well as Classification with K-Means Clustering to predict weither new examples are in fact legit bills, or counterfeit ones.
  The way the project had to be done was totally free: the programming language, the code used, etc. The only requirement was to respect the specifications.
