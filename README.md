# My_projects

I will share here some personal data and ML projects I did using Python with the Jupyter Notebook.

* The **Counterfeit detection** project is one I did in the context of my Data Analyst training. We're using Linear Regression to predict so missing values, and Logistic
  Regression as well as Classification with K-Means Clustering to predict weither new examples are in fact legit bills, or counterfeit ones.
  The way the project had to be done was totally free: the programming language, the code used, etc. The only requirement was of course, to respect the
  **specifications**.
